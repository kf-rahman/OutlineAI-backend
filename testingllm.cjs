I expect everyone to be respectful to each other, any posts that do not meet with the principles in Policy 33: Ethical Behaviour will be removed.\n\nIf you have a non-course content related question or concern you should feel free to email the instructor directly. Please send your emails from your uwaterloo.ca email address and include your student ID number.\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this course students should be able to:\nQuantify the morbidity and mortality in a population through the estimation and standardization of incidence and prevalence rates.\nInterpret the results from a study in the medical literature and identify the key components of a medical research question.\nSelect an appropriate study design and outline the major design elements.\nPerform basic data management and analyses in SAS.\nSelect an appropriate measure of association and statistics analysis methodology for a given design. Calculate estimates and conduct hypothesis testing.\nCommunicate the results of a completed analysis to both statistician and non-statisticians.\nTentative Course Schedule\n\nA full schedule for the term is given below. The course content will be delivered through in-person lectures and SAS tutorials.\n\n    Lectures/Modules: The course is divided into seven modules and then into a total of 22 sub-modules (M1.1, M1.2, ...). Each 80 minute lecture will cover one sub-module. Slides for each sub-module will be posted to LEARN before class and scanned, written notes from the lecture will be posted within 24 hours.\n     \n    SAS Tutorials: The SAS tutorials (T0, T1, ...) provide an introduction to the SAS statistical programming language. We will learn how to import and manipulate datasets, perform basic statistical analyses, and create professional looking plots and graphs. The goal of this tutorial is to equip students with a basic understanding of SAS so that as their statistical education progresses they can continue to perform more complex analyses. Each tutorial consists of a self-learning lesson following by a short tutorial exercise to be completed on your personal laptop. The exercises are designed to align with material from each module and highlight important concepts covered during that module. Students are encouraged to work together during the tutorial session. The instructor and/or TAs will be available to assist and answer questions. Tutorial exercises are due one week after the scheduled tutorial via Learn Dropboxes (see schedule below).\n     \n\nWeek\tDates\tTutorial and Lecture Topics\tReferences\tAssessment \n1\tWed 07-Sep\tM0 Introduction to Biostatistics\t \t \n \tFri 09-Sep\tNo tutorial today (complete T0 How to Access SAS University on your own this week)\t \t \n2\tMon 12-Sep\tM1.1 Incidence and Prevalence Rates\t2\t \n \tWed 14-Sep\tM1.2 Indirect Standardization\t \tA1 Released\n \tFri 16-Sep\tT1 Welcome to SAS\t \t \n3\tMon 19-Sep\tM1.3 Direct Standardization\t \t \n \tWed 21-Sep\tM2.1 Introduction to Medical Study Desigs\t3, 4\t \n \tFri 23-Sep\tT2 Standardization of Rates\t \tT1 Due 12:30pm\n4\tMon 26-Sep\tM2.2 Cross-Sectional Studies\t5, BaHamman et al.\t \n \tWed 28-Sep\tM2.3 Cohort Studies\t6, Steenstrup et al.\tA1 Due 11:59pm\n \tFri 30-Sep\tT3 Cohort Studies: Measures of Association\t \tT2 Due 12:30pm\n5\tMon 03-Oct\tM2.4 Hypothesis Testing for 2x2 Tables\t14.5, 15.1 – 15.3.1\t \n \tWed 05-Oct\tM3.1 Causation and Confounding\t1, 6.6, 10.1 – 10.2, 10.5, 11.1, 11.3 \tA2 Released\n \tFri 07-Oct\tT4 Chi-squared Tests, Confounding, and Sample Size\t \tT3 Due 12:30pm\n6\tMon 10-Oct\tThanksgiving\t \t \n \tWed 12-Oct\tReading Week (No class this week)\t \t \n \tFri 14-Oct\tReading Week (No tutorial this week)\t \t \n7\tMon 17-Oct\tM3.2 Multiple Linear Regression\t16 (except 16.3) \tProject Released\n \tWed 19-Oct\tM4.1 Case-Control Studies\t7.1 – 7.2, 7.4 – 7.5 \t \n \tFri 21-Oct\tT5 Linear Regression\t \tT4 Due 12:30pm\n8\tMon 24-Oct\tM4.2 Odds Ratios\t7.3\t \n \tWed 26-Oct\tM4.3 Confidence Intervals and Stratification\t14.4, Persaud et al.\tA2 Due 11:59pm, Deadline to form Project Groups\n \tFri 28-Oct\tT6 Analysis of Case-Control Studies\t \tT5 Due 12:30pm\n9\tMon 31-Oct\tMidterm Exam during Lecture Time\t \tMidterm Exam\n \tWed 02-Nov\tM4.4 Logistic Regression\t17.2\tA3 Released\n \tFri 04-Nov\tT7 Logistic Regression\t \tT6 Due 12:30pm\n10\tMon 07-Nov\tM5.1 Randomized Controlled Trials\t8.1 – 8.6, 8.9 \t \n \tWed 09-Nov\tM5.2 Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials\t8.8, 9, Villa et al.\tProject Proposals Due\n \tFri 11-Nov\tT8 Randomized Controlled Trials\t \tT7 Due 12:30pm\n11\tMon 14-Nov\tM5.3 Vaccines and Infectious Disease Epidemiology\t \t \n \tWed 16-Nov\tM6.1 Diagnostic Testing and Screening Introduction\t12.1 – 12.4 \tA3 Due 11:59pm\n \tFri 18-Nov\tNo tutorial today\t \tT8 Due 12:30pm\n12\tMon 21-Nov\tM6.2 ROC Curves\t12.5 – 12.6 \t \n \tWed 23-Nov\tM7.1 Period Life Tables\t \t \n \tFri 25-Nov\tT9 Calculating and Plotting ROC Curves\t \t \n13\tMon 28-Nov\tM7.2 Clinical Life Tables\t18.3\t \n \tWed 30-Nov\tM7.3 Kaplan-Meier Curves\t \tProject Due 11:59pm\n \tFri 02-Dec\tT10 Life Table Methods\t \tT9 Due 12:30pm\n14\tMon 05-Dec\tTBD - Make-up class or exam review session\t \t \n \tTues 06-Dec\t(Last day of classes)\t \tT10 Due 12:30pm, Project Peer Reviews Due\n \tFri 08-Dec\tFinal Exam Period Begins (Dec 9-23)\t \tFinal Exam TBD\n\n \nTexts / Materials\nTitle / Name \tNotes / Comments \tRequired\nStat 337 Course Notes \tPosted to the course web page or hard copies are available for order from https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/wprint \tYes\nKestenbaum, B (2019).

Each tutorial is graded on a pass/fail basis and is worth 0.5% for up to a total of 4% of your final grade. Successful completion of 8/10 tutorials will earn you the full 4%. No late tutorials will be accepted and no extensions will be given.\nAssignment Policies \n\nAssignments are due by 11:59pm ET via Crowdmark on Wednesdays September 28, October 26, and November 16. You will receive a personal link to submit your assignment via email at least one week before the due date. Assignments will be posted two weeks prior to their due date.\n\n    Submissions before the deadline: You can resubmit your assignment as many times as you like before the deadline.  It is your responsibility to make sure your solutions are visually clear (if your answers cannot be read you will receive a grade of zero) and that each question’s answer is uploaded separately into the correct section. Be sure to give yourself ample time to upload your solutions before the deadline.\n     \n    Late Assignments: Assignments will be accepted up to two days late with a 25% penalty assigned to each 24 hour period after the original deadline. Assignments more than 48 hours late will not be graded and will be awarded a grade of zero. \n     \n    Missed Assignments: Arrangements will be made if you miss an assignment due to a valid, documented, reason. See the section on Accommodation due to Illnes below. Note for your circumstance to be deemed valid you must have been incapacitated for a significant portion of the two-week assignment window.\n     \n    Retrieving Marked Assignments: A link to your graded assignment will be sent to you via email.\n     \n    Rules for Collaboration: Students are encouraged to discuss assignment exercises with each other, the TAs, and the course instructor. Any assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write their own solutions, including code (where relevant). Consulting another student’s solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. In particular, submitting solutions copied in whole or in part from an assignment submission or solution key from a previous offering of this course, or from an offering of any other course, is forbidden, even if a student is resubmitting their own work. These and any other forms of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating. Suspected cases of cheating will be immediately forwarded to the Associate Dean. If you have any questions about whether some activity constitutes cheating, please ask the instructor.\n     \n    Requests for re-grading: You may appeal the grading of an assignment by sending an email request to the instructor within one week of the date the assessment was returned. You must provide an explanation of why you feel you deserve a different mark. Your grade may go up or down as a result.\n\nMidterm Examination\n\nThe midterm examination will be held on Monday, October 31 during the regularly scheduled lecture time. Room and seat assignments will be accessible prior to the exam through: https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule\n\n    Calculators: Only Faculty of Mathematics approved calculators will be permitted during exams (for a list see: https://uwaterloo.ca/math/calculators )\n\nProject\n\nThe course project will consist of two parts: a written report and a pre-recorded video presentation. Students will work in groups of three to select a medical research question and report a synthesis of the results of several studies from the literature. Further details regarding the project will be released later in the term (see course schedule above).\nFinal Examination\n\nThe final examination will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office and held during the University Exam Period (December 9 - 23, 2022). Arrangements for students with official conflicts will be handled on a case by case basis. Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time.\n\n    Incompletes: Students who are unable to complete the final exam for a valid, documented reason will only be eligible for a grade of incomplete (INC) if they have a passing grade (≥50%) on the assignment plus midterm portion of their grade going in to the final. Students who do not write the midterm for any reason are not eligible for an INC grade. Also see \"Accommodation due to Illness\" and \"Accommodation for students who cannot attend classes due to illness or self-isolation\" sections below.\n\n \nAssignment Screening\n\nAssignments and exams will be screened informally by the instructor and teaching assistants.\nNotice of Recording\n\nFor the project you will also be required to create a video presentation with your group and upload it to LEARN for assessment. For more information, see the Student Notice of Recording in the Course Information folder on LEARN.\nAdministrative Policy\n\nCOVID-19 Precautions and Contingency Planning: Students must adhere to all University of Waterloo COVID-19 mandatory safety precautions (see https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/). Do not come to class or other in-person activities if you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or are required to self-isolate. To help you decide if you should isolate, you can use the provincial self-assessment tool. In the scenario where we must transition back online the following contingencies will be used:\nOn-campus activity\tOnline replacement\nLectures\tPre-recorded videos posted to LEARN, along with slides\nTutorials\tStudents complete and submit tutorials from home. Optional synchronous Teams meeting with instructor and/or TA available to assist and answer questions\nMidterm Exam\tTimed Crowdmark assessment at originally scheduled date and time (see schedule above)\nProject\tNo change\nFinal Exam\tTimed Crowdmark assessment at the time scheduled by the Registrar's office\n\n    Short-term (e.g., one-week) cancellation of in-person classes: We will follow the above plans\n    Long-term cancellation of in-person classes: We will follow the above plans\n    Cancellation of in-person (midterm or final) examinations: We will follow the above plans\n    Accommodation for students who cannot attend classes due to illness or self-isolation: Lecture slides will be posted to LEARN for each class. A playlist of videos from the Spring 2020 offering of the class will also be posted. These should align fairly well with the current delivery but there may be some variations in content and topics. Students are encouraged to attend virtual office hours to ask questions and clarify the material as needed. Assignments and Project work can continue online. If the student misses the midterm or final exam then alternative arrangements will be made (including but not limited to: an in-person written make-up exam, an online alternative as noted above, an oral examination).\n\nAccommodation due to Illness: When you believe your illness or circumstances will impact your academic studies you must follow the instructions on the Faculty of Mathematics' Accommodations webpage. In verified cases, alternative arrangements will be made at the discretion of the instructor (including but not limited to: an extension of the due date, moving the weight of the assessment to the final exam, an in-person written make-up exam or an oral examination).\n\nIntellectual Property and Copyright Notice: The course notes, lecture slides, assignments, exams, and written lecture notes provided to you are all under the copyright of the current and previous course instructor(s).

[Check the Office of Academic Integrity for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline. For typical penalties, check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties.\n\nAppeals: A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71, Student Discipline may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72, Student Appeals.\n\nNote for students with disabilities: AccessAbility Services, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.\n\nTurnitin.com: Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.\n"},

      "LABORATORY OVERVIEW\n" +
      "Labs are NOT held during the first week of term.\n" +
      "Week Topic\n" +
      "2 - 3 Lab #1 – Device Characterization and Biasing Circuits\n" +
      "4 - 5 Lab #2 – Single-Stage Amplifiers\n" +
      "8 - 9 Lab #3 – Multistage Amplifiers\n" +
      "10 - 11 Lab #4 – Feedback Circuits\n" +
      "12 - 13 Lab #5 – Active Filters\n" +
      "LABORATORY OPERATION\n" +
      "• Each student in the course is required to pass the lab safety quiz prior to attempting any\n" +
      "of the laboratories. The quiz will be available on Avenue to Learn.\n" +
      "• Access to all labs is restricted in the interest of security and safety. Information on\n" +
      "accessing and using the lab can be found on the webpage:\n" +
      "https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece/labs-and-health-safety/#tab-content-labs-access-and-\n" +
      "use\n" +
      "• Lab Experiments:\n" +
      "o Every student can conduct the lab experiment individually at home.\n" +
      "o There are two TAs on duty at a time. One TA will be available in the lab room, and\n" +
      "the other TA will be on Microsoft Teams from 14:30 to 17:20 to help students solve\n" +
      "the problems encountered in experimenting.\n" +
      "o The TAs on duty will not help students to experiment, and group discussions are\n" +
      "encouraged.\n" +

      "Page 5 of 10\n" +
      "• Lab Requirements:\n" +
      "o Every student conducts the lab work individually; even group discussion is\n" +
      "encouraged.\n" +
      "o Every student needs to submit their lab report and experiment results on Avenue to\n" +
      "Learn individually on the due date described in the lab manual. No group report nor\n" +
      "late submission will be accepted.\n" +
      "o MSAF transfers the weight of missed lab work to that of the final exam.\n" +
      "o Every student will be interviewed at least once online by TAs to check the simulation\n" +
      "work. Contact the TA for further instructions if you use MSAF in the lab scheduled for\n" +
      "the interview. Absence from attending the scheduled lab interview results in\n" +
      "zero for the corresponding lab work.\n" +
      "ASSESSMENT\n" +
      "Grading and Evaluation Policies\n" +
      "• There are five (5) labs, one (1) mid-term exam, and one (1) final exam to be evaluated in\n" +
      "this course.\n" +
      "• All exams are open books and notes.\n" +
      "• All grades are final unless error(s) in marking is proven.\n" +
      "• No make-up/deferred mid-term exam\n" +
      "• Every exam counts. There is no policy for poor mid-term exam marks to be replaced by\n" +
      "better final exams (or vice versa).\n" +
      "• MSAF transfers the weight of a missed mid-term exam to that of the final exam.\n" +
      "• The deferred final exam may be oral, depending on the number of students examined.\n" +
      "ACADEMIC INTEGRITY\n" +
      "You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning\n" +
      "process. The academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic\n" +
      "integrity. It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.\n" +
      "Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in\n" +
      "unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences,\n" +
      "Component Weight\n" +
      "Labs (5) 30 %\n" +
      "Mid-term Exam (1) 30 %\n" +

      "• improper collaboration in group work.\n" +
      "• copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.\n" +
      "AUTHENTICITY / PLAGIARISM DETECTION\n" +
      "Some courses may use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal authenticity and\n" +
      "ownership of student-submitted work. For courses using such software, students will be\n" +
      "expected to submit their work electronically either directly to Turnitin.com or via an online\n" +
      "learning platform (e.g., A2L, etc.) using plagiarism detection (a service supported by\n" +
      "Turnitin.com) so it can be checked for academic dishonesty.\n" +
      "Students who do not wish their work to be submitted through the plagiarism detection software\n" +
      "must inform the Instructor before the assignment is due. No penalty will be assigned to a\n" +
      "student who does not submit work to the plagiarism detection software. All submitted work is\n" +
      "subject to normal verification that standards of academic integrity have been upheld (e.g., online\n" +
